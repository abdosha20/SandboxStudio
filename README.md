Design a user interface that matches the theme of the website, including fonts and styles.
The design should include Login/Logout and Sign in/Remove account features.

The user should be able to see what plan they have requested. If none is selected, they should be prompted with the available options, and this should be recorded in their account with a progress bar displayed.

Admins should be able to access the user portal, see what the user has requested, and reply back either via a live chat feature or a formal email using the email they signed up with. Admins should not be able to see passwords, so encryption is required.

Chat history MUST be removed 24 hours after it starts.

Check (product.html) and (styles.css) for reference. Advise the project manager when there are changes that must be made to other files.

Hand-in timeframe: 24 hours for whoever receives this task.
